# VFB expression pattern sequencing ontologies

Ontologies of RNAseq data from samples purified based on driver expression. Metadata is obtained from NCBI, expression data is obtained from GEO. We are not using any data that is not associated with a particular driver (e.g. control samples).

Each dataset has its own ontology file with the NCBI BioProject ID as its filename.

## Contact

Please use this GitHub repository's [Issue tracker](https://github.com/VirtualFlyBrain/vfb-EPseq-ontology/issues) to report errors or specific concerns related to the ontology.
