1. FBgn0003926 was obsoleted in FlyBase and therefore removed from the _FINAL data.
2. FBtp0092375 has no VFBexp ID, so this driver was not included.
3. 'FBgn0036125', 'FBgn0037417' and 'FBgn0050456' have been split in FlyBase.
  a) based on name in tpm file, 'FBgn0036125' should be 'FBgn0286980' (Iyd).
  b) unclear whether 'FBgn0037417' (Osi10) maps to Osi10a or Osi10b, so removing this gene.
  c) unclear whether 'FBgn0050456' (CG30456) maps to CG46491 or CG46492, so removing this gene.
